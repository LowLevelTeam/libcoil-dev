# libcoil-dev
A COIL Development Library

core/ defines a standard way to replace the C standard library. The C standard library is never used in this development library.

format/ defines a standard intermediate representation for a programming API for handling the most annoying sections like header handling, section handling and more. 

libcoil-dev is a way for COIL programs in the tool chain to utilize a standard base for creating applications without rewriting code and potentially causing bugs, errors and unforeseen execution.
